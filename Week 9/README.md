CYBER SECURITY ASSIGNMENT WEEK 9

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

Objective: Setup a honeypot and intercept some attempted attacks in the wild.
Which Honeypot(s) you deployed:

Dionaea over HTTP

Any issues you encountered:

I had problems with installing and getting the Honeypot set up. The virtual machine would not propery create the Honeypot website properly. I had issues installing the Google SDK and I had reinstall it and redo the assignment using the gcloud shell. This only worked after I redid the steps more than once. After figuring out how to install, everything proceded to work smoothly.

A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc:

I collected 549 attacks on my honeypot. I left it on for a couple of hours.

Any unresolved questions raised by the data collected:

How are people exploiting my Honeypot from other locations aroudn the world from the split second it was created? How vulnerable am I from anything I do on the web? The data collected showed me that I am not allowed to be as carefree as I thought I could be on the internet as I am very susceptible to attacks from around the world including India.
